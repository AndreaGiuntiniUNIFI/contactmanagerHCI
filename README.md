# Contact Manager HCI Project

### Application features :

The aim of this project is to build an application able to manage contacts. The features that are implemented are mainly the following ones :

1) Add a new contact
2) Search for a contact, filtering by different fields
3) Visualize all the contacts, with the possibility to order in an ascending or descending way, based on a field
4) Visualize single contacts, being able to modify or delete it

The contacts are saved persistently, through a dictionary, using the pickle functions.
